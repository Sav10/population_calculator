# population_calculator

The goal is to calculate population size around a geographic point
It somehow forked from an original method from Anna (https://github.com/anouchk/PopCentrales)
I used the same conversion method, but using pandas dataframe, which made it much easier to do
If you just want to convert a population, just use distances_geostat_convert
If you want to understand the method, you are welcome to use the distances_geostat_exploration notebook
